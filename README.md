# McGill cover letter latex template

I chose to create this latex template for McGill cover letters based on the instructions found 
in https://www.mcgill.ca/visual-identity/download-mcgill-logo because McGill doesn't offer latex 
templates.

Requirements:
  - Latex distribution (e.g. MikTex, TeX Live)

  - Compilation: PDFLatex
